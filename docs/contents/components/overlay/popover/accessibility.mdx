`Popover` follows the [WAI-ARIA - Dialog (Modal) Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) for accessibility.

## Keyboard Navigation

When the `Popover` opens, focus is trapped within it. That is, you cannot focus on elements outside the popover unless the popover is closed.

| Key             | Description                                                                                                                                                        | State                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`           | Focuses the next element within the popover that is not disabled. If it's the last element, focuses the first element within the popover that is not disabled.     | `isOpen={true}`                       |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Focuses the previous element within the popover that is not disabled. If it's the first element, focuses the last element within the popover that is not disabled. | `isOpen={true}`                       |
| `Escape`        | Closes the popover.                                                                                                                                                | `isOpen={true}` + `closeOnEsc={true}` |
